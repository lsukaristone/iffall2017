		Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
		<br>
		Raf movin' slow like a creep
		<br>
		Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
		<br>
		And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that <em id="paren">(I can't)</em>
		<br>
		When's the last time I asked for some help that
		<br>
		I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
		<br>
		I couldn't get from nobody out there <em id="paren">(I can't)</em>

		I don't get weak in the knees 
		<br>
		Hundreds spread out like a fan
		<br>
		Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
		<br>
		Open the sky, get a handful
		<br>
		Torso marked up like a vandal
		<br>
		How you not fuckin' with cash?
		<br>
		God gave you what you could handle
		<br>
		Gave you what you could handle
		<br>
		I got the grip like the handle
		<br>
		And I'm bikin'
		<br>
		I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
		<br>
		Hades got the angels
		<br>
		TV's got the angles
		<br>
		I'm brakin'... got...

		Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
		<br>
		Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
		<br>
		I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
		<br>
		How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
		<br>
		The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
		<br>
		On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
		<br>
		The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
		<br>
		Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
		<br>
		Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
		<br>
		Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
		<br>
		Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
		<br>
		Me and my baby can't do on our own
		<br>
		I landed a trick, got my impossibles
		<br>
		I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
		<br>
		24 hours like they never close
		<br>
		I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
		<br>
		Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
		<br>
		I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads <em id="paren">(obstacles)</em>
		<br>
		I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
		<br>
		Savage, is bikin', yeah
	</p>
<br>
	<p id="verse3">
		Transition lightning <em id="paren">(ascending)</em>
		<br>
		Ashes and reminisce of ballers
		<br>
		Body to study
		<br>
		A Bentley that used to be flawless
		<br>
		I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
		<br>
		Scattered, the showers
		<br>
		Don't scaffold the towers
		<br>
		I'm up, mom, I promise
		<br>
		In class with the honors
		<br>
		No cheat like I'm honest
		<br>
		And how did I become so accomplished?
		<br>
		'Cause I don't see foes
		<br>
		I just see a cold
		<br>
		I just see a hold
		<br>
		Chinks in your armor
		<br>
		Like Pac in the Hummer
		<br>
		Like Jigga in the summer
		<br>
		Left the house like Obama
		<br>
		Hit the road like a runner
		<br>
		Hit the road like Road Runner
		<br>
		I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking
